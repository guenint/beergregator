BeerGregator

This will be a python application that takes a trip between two locations and outputs the most popular craft beers to drink on the route based on location, beer style, and beer availability.

This app will use:
	BreweryDB API for information on a beer; JSON format
	BeerMapping API for locations to get beer & breweries; JSON format
	List of cities' longitudes and latitudes
	Untappd API for ratings

What is not in these frameworks, and what I will be doing:

	Generate easy entry method: Type in two cities and style of beer, and the program will generate a top 10 list of beers on the trip between using 10 evenly spaced locations on the trip between.

	Alternatively, you could enter an existing beer and two cities, and it will find top beers similar to to the existing one based on style and brewery location

	Python will be written to ignore "macrobrews" from the API and focus on smaller, craft beers

Goals:

	To get a better understanding of how to use and parse APIs to achieve a good result. This application will use three APIs, so the trick is having it be efficient.

Optional:

	Keep persistent storage and be able to show user history
